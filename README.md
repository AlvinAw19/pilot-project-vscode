# Development Environment

This application is defined with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) V1.
Docker Compose is included in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).<br/>
Run this command to initiate the Docker environment:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```
**Note:** Technically the command is `docker-compose`. However, for Mac user that uses 
Docker Desktop version 4.23.0 and above, the command might 
not work. Therefore using `docker compose` is the answers. 
Alternatively use the work around suggested [here.](https://github.com/docker/docs/pull/20906) 

## Ports

Docker Compose for development environment exposes following ports:

- 8080 (HTTP) http://localhost:8080/
- 3307 (MySQL) username and password are set in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

If another application is using these ports, Docker Compose can't start.
Please stop that application before starting Docker Compose.

## PHP

Docker Compose has `php-app` service.
Use it to run Composer or CakePHP commands.
Commands in Docker Compose run at `/var/www/html` under [app](app) directory.

For example, run following command after `docker compose up -d` to install dependencies:

```sh
docker compose exec php-app composer install
```

### Debugging

The Docker Compose for `php-app` service had been configured with debugging engine Xdebug.<br/>
Please configure the IDE with debugging support for Xdebug by referring to [How to Debug using IntelliJ IDEA](https://redmine2.tyrellsys.com/issues/75611).

### Basic Coding Standard & Quality

To ensure the written code following the basic coding standard & quality, we've configured the Docker Compose for `php-app` service with tools:
1. PHP Code Sniffer (PHPCS) based on CakePHP coding standard rules.
2. PHPStan - PHP Static Analysis Tool.

Everytime making a changes to the code, please run both commands as follows:

```sh
docker compose exec php-app composer check
```

```sh
docker compose exec php-app composer cs-fix
```

If either both tools complaint about errors, then please fix following the basic coding standard & quality.

## Frontend Assets

This project uses Laravel Mix (webpack) to compile and manage frontend assets (`frontend/src`) located in these folders; `js`, `scss`, `css`, `img`, `font`

### First-Time Setup

Before running any `npm` commands, install dependencies:
```shell
docker compose exec node npm install
```

### Available `npm` Commands:

- **Production build** (minifies assets):
  ```sh
  docker compose exec node npm run build
  ```
  Compiles and copies assets to `app/webroot/` (PHP's public directory).
- **Development watch mode:**
  ```sh
  docker compose exec node npm run watch
  ```
  Automatically recompiles & copies files to `app/webroot` when changes are detected.
